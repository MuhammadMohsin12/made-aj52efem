# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Analyzing the Impact of US Industrial Sectors on Climate Change and Economic Growth (2010-2020)


## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
How do different industrial sectors in the United States contribute to both economic growth and climate change, and what are the relationships between sectoral GDP contribution and their corresponding environmental impacts from 2010 to 2020?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The relationship between industrial growth and climate change is a critical challenge facing the United States, because industries are both essential drivers of economic prosperity and major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. This project analyzes the dual impact of major US industrial sectors on economic growth and climate change, using statistical analysis of industry-specific GDP data and environmental impact data. The results can give insights into which industries provide the best balance of economic benefits versus environmental costs, helping policymakers and business leaders make informed decisions about industrial development and environmental regulation.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

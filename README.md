# Analyzing the Impact of US Industrial Sectors on Climate Change and Economic Growth (2010-2020)

## Main Question
**How do different industrial sectors in the United States contribute to both economic growth and climate change, and what are the relationships between sectoral GDP contribution and their corresponding environmental impacts from 2010 to 2020?**

## Description
The relationship between industrial growth and climate change is a critical challenge facing the United States, as industries are both essential drivers of economic prosperity and major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. This project analyzes the dual impact of major US industrial sectors on economic growth and climate change, using statistical analysis of industry-specific GDP data and environmental impact data. The results provide insights into which industries offer the best balance of economic benefits versus environmental costs, aiding policymakers and business leaders in making informed decisions about industrial development and environmental regulation.
